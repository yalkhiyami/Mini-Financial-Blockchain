This is the readme file for the blockchain project

Open the blockchain.py file on any compiler and run it. It will show you the number of blocks
and the true/falses of an example I have above. 

Now, copy the code onto jupyter notebook, and call any block you want, like chain[0], chain[1]
and it will display the dictionary of that block, the names, the transactions and balances.
